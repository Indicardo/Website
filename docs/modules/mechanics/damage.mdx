### Friendly Fire

Allows teammates to kill each other. Arrows will be absorbed if they hit a teammate.

```xml
<friendlyfire>on</friendlyfire> <!-- Defaults to off -->
```

Refunds arrows blocked by teammates from non-infinity bows.

```xml
<friendlyfirerefund>off</friendlyfirerefund> <!-- Defaults to on -->
```

### Difficulty

The difficulty level can be set to `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, or `hard`. The default is `hard`.

```xml
<difficulty>easy</difficulty> <!-- Defaults to hard -->
```

### Hunger

Specify if a player can starve to death, usually used with the difficulty setting.<br/>
This can also be accomplished with the `naturalRegeneration` [gamerule](/docs/modules/mechanics/gamerules).

```xml
<hunger>
    <depletion>off</depletion>
</hunger>
```

### Damage Filtering

This module is used to filter when or if damage is applied to entities.
Its contents can be a filter or combination of filters.
It doesn't have to be `<allow>` and `<deny>` at the top level but that's usually what you want.
Regions can also be used since they are filters that filter for a location.

_Examples_

```xml
<damage>
    <deny>
        <cause>explosion</cause>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

```xml
<!-- Deny damage events where the attacker is on the red team -->
<damage>
    <deny>
        <attacker>
            <team>red</team>
        </attacker>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

```xml
<!-- Deny fall damage for players using the Eagle class -->
<damage>
    <deny>
        <all>
            <class>eagle</class>
            <cause>fall</cause>
        </all>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

### Disable Damage

Use this module to disable damage from specific causes.

While almost every form of damage can be disabled safely it is recommended that you do **not** disable `VOID` damage.

<div className="table-container">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Disable Damage Element</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Value/Children</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>{`<disabledamage> </disabledamage>`}</label>
        </td>
        <td>Node containing the disabled damage types.</td>
        <td />
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Sub-elements</th>
        <th />
        <th />
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>{`<damage> </damage>`}</label>
        </td>
        <td>The damage type that is disabled.</td>
        <td>
          <a href="#damage-causes">Damage Cause</a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

_Example_

```xml
<disabledamage>
    <!-- Disable fall damage -->
    <damage>fall</damage>
</disabledamage>
```

#### Block Explosion Attributes

The `BLOCK_EXPLOSION` damage cause has several extended attributes to customize who/what gets damaged. Only attributes with `false` as the value need to be explicitly defined since all attributes default to `true`.

<div className="table-container">
  <table className="table table-striped table-condensed">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Default</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>ally</label>
        </td>
        <td>
          Damage to players on the same team as the person that caused the
          explosion.
        </td>
        <td>
          <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>self</label>
        </td>
        <td>Damage to the person that caused the explosion.</td>
        <td>
          <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>enemy</label>
        </td>
        <td>
          Damage to players not on the same team as the person that caused the
          explosion.
        </td>
        <td>
          <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <label>other</label>
        </td>
        <td>Any other damage caused by the explosion.</td>
        <td>
          <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

_Example_

```xml
<disabledamage>
    <!-- TNT damages enemies and self, but not teammates -->
    <damage ally="true" self="false" enemy="false" other="false">block explosion</damage>
</disabledamage>
```

### Damage Causes

The following damage causes can be used in the disable damage module.
These causes do not need to be capitalized or contain underscores, i.e., `FIRE_TICK` and `fire tick` will both work.

<div className="table-container">
  <table>
    <thead>
