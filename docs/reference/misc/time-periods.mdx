title: Time Periods
---

Time periods are numbers suffixed with a time unit. Periods with no formatter suffix default to seconds.

In some contexts, `oo` can be used to indicate an infinite time period.

| Suffix | Duration |
|---|---|
| `d` | Day |
| `h` | Hour |
| `m` | Minute |
| `s` | Second |

### Examples

```xml
<!-- 5 minutes -->
<time>5m</time>

<!-- Combine multiple units for a more specific timing -->
<time>8m20s</time> <!-- Identical to 500s -->
```
