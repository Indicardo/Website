title: Using Filters and Regions
---

Regions define areas that can later be applied to [Filters](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters)
and other modules.
Understanding how modules and filters work together is important to make functional mechanics.

## Creating a Region

Creating a [Region](docs/modules/mechanics/filters) involves certain world coordinates.
In this example, we will create a simple `<cuboid/>` region, which we will save with the ID of `red-spawn`
which we can reference for later use.

```xml
<regions>
    <cuboid id="red-spawn" min="20,0,55" max="40,10,75"/>
</regions>
```

## Creating a Filter

Creating a [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) allows us to put restrictions on certain events.
We want to filter players that are entering a region, so we will make a basic filter that matches for
players on a certian team.

```xml
<filters>
    <!-- Filter will pass ALLOW once all the conditions are met -->
    <all id="only-red">
        <!-- is player on the red team? -->
        <team>red-team</team>
    </all>
</filters>
```

## Applying a Filter to a Region

Applying filters to a region is done inside the `<regions>` module.
When we make our `<apply/>` module, we can use the IDs in our region and filter to reference them.
Out of the various [events](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions#apply-element-attributes),
we will use the `enter` event.
When a player enters our region, we want to make sure that only players on the red team are able to enter it.
So we apply our `only-red` filter to players that are entering the `red-spawn` region.

```xml
<regions>
    <cuboid id="red-spawn" min="20,0,55" max="40,10,75"/>
    <!-- checks only-red if a player is allowed to enter -->
    <apply region="red-spawn" enter="only-red"/>
</regions>
<filters>
    <!-- only players on Red will be allowed to enter -->
    <all id="only-red">
        <team>red-team</team>
    </all>
</filters>
```

## Applying multiple things to regions

Typically we want to prevent players from placing any blocks in spawn,
so the `<union>` element will be used to combine the two spawn regions.
Then an `<apply/>` module can be used for both regions at once.
This will use the built-in `never` filter, which denies everything.

```xml
<regions>
    <union id="spawns">
        <cuboid id="red-spawn" min="20,0,55" max="40,10,75"/>
        <cuboid id="blue-spawn" min="10,0,-55" max="30,10,-75"/>
    </union>
    <apply region="red-spawn" enter="only-red"/>
    <apply region="blue-spawn" enter="only-blue"/>
    <!-- denies all block place and block break events in both red-spawn and blue-spawn -->
    <apply region="spawns" block="never"/>
</regions>
<filters>
    <all id="only-red">
        <team>red-team</team>
    </all>
    <all id="only-blue">
        <team>red-team</team>
    </all>
</filters>
```
