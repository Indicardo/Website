title: Airship Battle (DTC)
---

Airship Battle is the first ever map made for PGM.
It features two wooden airships with building materials, tools, and weapons inside chests.
The objective of the map is to leak the lava contained inside an obsidian sphere by destroying it.
Whoever leaks the other team's core first wins the game.

_Players build across to the other ship, either at ground level or bridging ontop of the propellers._

_The large spawn area where observers spawn at, players spawn inside the safe bedrock
tunnels and run into the ship._

![](/img/examples/airship3.png)
_The obsidian core that which you must leak the lava out of!
Make the lava leak by destroying the obsidian blocks containing it and other obsticles that might get in the way._
